# Assembly Integer Overflow Vulnerability

This repository demonstrates a potential integer overflow vulnerability in assembly code that could lead to unexpected memory access.  The vulnerability stems from a calculation involving multiplication which could potentially exceed the maximum value for a 32-bit register, resulting in an invalid memory address being accessed.

## Vulnerability Description

The vulnerable code involves the following instruction:

`mov eax, [ebx+esi*4+0x10]`

This instruction accesses memory using an address calculated by adding ebx, esi*4, and 0x10. If esi is large enough, the multiplication could cause an integer overflow. The overflow can lead to the process trying to access memory locations outside of its allocated space, resulting in segmentation faults or unpredictable behavior.

## Solution

A robust solution needs to ensure that the calculated address is within the valid memory range. This may involve range checks before memory access or using larger registers to handle larger values.

## Mitigation Strategies

- **Bounds Checking:**  Before performing the memory access, explicitly check the bounds of the calculated address. Ensure that the address lies within a valid range for the current process.
- **Larger Registers:** Utilize 64-bit registers if available to prevent the overflow.
- **Compiler Optimizations:** If the assembly is generated by a compiler, examine compiler options that may detect or mitigate integer overflow issues.
